`actionable-recourse` is a python library for recourse verification and reporting. 

## Recourse in Machine Learning?


*Recourse* is the ability of a person to change the prediction of a machine learning model by altering *actionable* input variables â€“ e.g., `income` and `n_credit_cards` as opposed to `age` or `alma_mater`.

Recourse is an essential aspect of procedural fairness in consumer-facing applications of machine learning. When a consumer is denied a loan by a machine learning model, for example, they should be able to change the input variables of the model in a way that guarantees approval. Otherwise, this person will be denied the loan so long as the model is deployed, and stripped of the ability to influence a decision that affects their livelihood. 

## Verification & Reporting

This library provides protect consumers against this harm through verification and reporting. These tools can be used to answer questions like:

- What can a person do to obtain a favorable prediction from a given model?
- How many people can change their prediction?
- How difficult for people to change their prediction?
 
Specific functionality includes:

- Customize the set of feasible action for each input variable of an machine learning model.
- Produce a list of actionable changes for a person to flip the prediction of a model.
- Estimate the feasibility of recourse of a model on a population of interest.
- Evaluate the difficulty of recourse of a model on a population of interest.

The tools are currently designed to support linear classification models, and will be extended to cover other kinds of models over time.

## Installation

You can install the library via `pip`.
```
$ pip install actionable-recourse
```

### Requirements

- Python 3
- Python-MIP or CPLEX  

#### CPLEX

CPLEX is fast optimization solver with a Python API. It is commercial software, but free to download for students and faculty at accredited institutions. To obtain CPLEX:

1. Register for [IBM Academic Initiative](https://www.ibm.com/academic/technology/data-science)
2. Download the *IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio* from the [software catalog](https://www-03.ibm.com/isc/esd/dswdown/searchPartNumber.wss?partNumber=CJ6BPML)
3. Install the CPLEX Optimization Studio (on MacOS, run `./<cplex-path>/Contents/MacOS`).
4. Setup the CPLEX Python API [as described here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.10.0/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/GettingStarted/topics/set_up/Python_setup.html).

If you have problems installing CPLEX, please check the [CPLEX user manual](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P/welcome) or the [CPLEX forums](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/forum?id=11111111-0000-0000-0000-000000002059). 


### Usage
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import recourse as rs

# import data
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ustunb/actionable-recourse/master/examples/paper/data/credit_processed.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
y, X = df.iloc[:, 0], df.iloc[:, 1:]

# train a classifier
clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter = 1000)
clf.fit(X, y)
yhat = clf.predict(X)

# customize the set of actions
A = rs.ActionSet(X)  ## matrix of features. ActionSet will set bounds and step sizes by default

# specify immutable variables
A['Married'].mutable = False

# can only specify properties for multiple variables using a list
A[['Age_lt_25', 'Age_in_25_to_40', 'Age_in_40_to_59', 'Age_geq_60']].mutable = False

# education level
A['EducationLevel'].step_direction = 1  ## force conditional immutability.
A['EducationLevel'].step_size = 1  ## set step-size to a custom value.
A['EducationLevel'].step_type = "absolute"  ## force conditional immutability.
A['EducationLevel'].bounds = (0, 3)

A['TotalMonthsOverdue'].step_size = 1  ## set step-size to a custom value.
A['TotalMonthsOverdue'].step_type = "absolute"  ## discretize on absolute values of feature rather than percentile values
A['TotalMonthsOverdue'].bounds = (0, 100)  ## set bounds to a custom value.

## get model coefficients and align
A.align(clf)  ## tells `ActionSet` which directions each feature should move in to produce positive change.

# Get one individual
i = np.flatnonzero(yhat <= 0).astype(int)[0]

# build a flipset for one individual
fs = rs.Flipset(x = X.values[i], action_set = A, clf = clf)
fs.populate(enumeration_type = 'distinct_subsets', total_items = 10)
fs.to_latex()
fs.to_html()

# Run Recourse Audit on Training Data
auditor = rs.RecourseAuditor(A, coefficients = clf.coef_, intercept = clf.intercept_)
audit_df = auditor.audit(X)  ## matrix of features over which we will perform the audit.

## print mean feasibility and cost of recourse
print(audit_df['feasible'].mean())
print(audit_df['cost'].mean())
print_recourse_audit_report(X, audit_df, y)
# or produce additional information of cost of recourse by other variables
# print_recourse_audit_report(X, audit_df, y, group_by = ['y', 'Married', 'EducationLevel'])

```
