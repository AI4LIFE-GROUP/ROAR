This folder contains notebooks to showcase the tools in `actionable-recourse` and to reproduce experiments from our paper.

## Notebooks

### [Reporting Recourse](/ex_01_quickstart.ipynb) 

This notebook shows how to produce a flipset â€“ i.e., a list of actions that allow a person to change the prediction of a model.  

### [Auditing Recourse](/ex_02_audit_model-effects-of-recourse-demo.ipynb)

This notebook shows how we can run evaluate the cost and feasibility over a sample of individuals.

### [Out-of-Sample Deployment](/ex_03_audit_out-of-sample-demo.ipynb)

This notebook shows how the cost and feasibility of recourse can change when a model is deployed in practice. 

### [Disparities in Recourse](/ex_04_audit_demo-disparities-in-recourse.ipynb)

This notebook shows how our tools can be used to evaluate disparities in the cost and feasibility recourse.
